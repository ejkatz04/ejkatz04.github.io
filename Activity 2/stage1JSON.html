/*We put our script tag at the bottom of our body tag. This is because: by putting our script there, any of the rendering we do (any of the elements we produce in our body tag) are rendered to the screen in advance of running the script. That means as this script is running, we'll actually see whats on the screen. That's nice as opposed to having this blank screen waiting for something to load, then drawing the elements. The other benefit of putting our script there is that if I have elements inside the body tag that I want to access I cannot do it until they've been rendered
