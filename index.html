        <td>In this stage, we configured the photo resources and created the file structure and template. This will be very useful because I will be putting in an image that will be used for my title card. This image will be utilizing the parallax effect (where when scrolling, the image's place does not move, but the scrolling occurs.) Additionally, this is the stage where we created the HTML file structure and template. This will be the building block for all of my sites that I create.</td>

Duplicating elements will be very helpful because this will help me when I am adding multiple flipboxes to my site, which will have different facts on each of them. I put each image on a different flip box and a question on the back to make the user of the site think. I also used the hex value picker within photoshop to make the color scheme match.</td>

        <td>In this stage, we set up the flex box. I arranged all 17 of the flipboxes in a div tag to make the flipboxes rearrange with different sizes of the window that the site is being displayed on. A flex box is very useful because it allows for the site to look good on smaller windows. This is good because my site may be used in a small window and I want it to dynamically re-arrange if it is used in a different sized window.</td>

We used javascript to dynamically change the margin size based on the size of the window that the site is being used on. This activity used what is called a document-object model to change the margin size. This model is very useful for changing and adjusting elements that appear on your site. This will be used in my site because I want my site to change depending on the window that the website is being used on. To look clean, this will require changing the margin size which uses a document-object model.</td>
